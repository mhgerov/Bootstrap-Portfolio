					I was born in 1989 in Boca Raton, FL. I lived in that area until I was 8, then moved to Atlanta, GA. I graduated Georgia Tech with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, taking a year and a half off for Army obligations. I commissioned into the Signal Corps after graduating and was stationed at Fort Bragg, NC for 2 and a half years. I moved back to Atlanta after finishing my Army obligation.

					I am currently a student at the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. My main interests are doing back-end development. I am looking to move to Seattle after finishing my education. I eventually plan on getting a masters in computer science. I have basic experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Pythong, Ruby, and C.
